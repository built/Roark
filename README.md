Roark
--------
Roark is a CSS layout editor for Windows. This code is more of a sketch or exploration than a real working project.

You can read about the full concept in concept.txt. There's also a brief demo video here: http://vimeo.com/1486536

I created this in the spring or summer of 2008 while doing some web work with Blueprint CSS. I was tired of trying to describe the layout I wanted in clumsy text and I thought a GUI approach to design would be nice. I was right, it *was* nice! Unfortunately getting the client's project done became more important than creating little tools like this so I never got it finished. I did get to eat though, so that is something. :)


### Platform
The code is in C# and was developed on the .Net 3.5 platform.
